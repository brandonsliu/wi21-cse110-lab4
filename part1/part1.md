1. Print prices.length, var is visible through blocks
2. Print the discountedPrice of last element of prices, var is visible through blocks and discountedPrice will have the value given in the last loop
3. Print the finalPrice of the last element of prices, it is assigned a value in the last loop
4. [50, 100, 300]. The function returns an array of with the elements of prices([100,200,300]) reduced by a discount(.5). 
5. Error, let i is only reachable within the block
6. Error, let is only reachable within the for loop
7. Print the final price of the last item, finalPrice is declared outside of the forloop
8. [50, 100, 300]. The function returns an array of with the elements of prices([100,200,300]) reduced by a discount(.5). 
9. Print array of discountedPrices, const arrays can add items
10. Print discountedPrice of last item, scop of cosnt is only within the loop
11. Print 0, const finalPRice cannot be changed
12. 90, discounted is const and cannot be changed.
13. A. student.name
    B. student['Grad Year']
    C. student.greeting()
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
14. A. '32', 2 is converted to a string
    B. 1, '3' is converted to a number
    C. 3, null is converted to the number 0
    D. '3null', null is converted to a string
    E. 4, true is converted to the number 1
    F. 0, false and null are both converted to the number 0
    G. '3undefined', undefined is converted to a string
    H. NaN, undefined is converted to a number
15. A. true, '2' was converted to a number
    B. false, both were converted to a number
    C. true, '2' was converted to a number
    D. false, the types of the two are not the same
    E. false, true is equivalent to the number 1
    F. true, Boolean(2) is true
16. == converts the two to the same type then compares, while === keeps them as they are and compares both values and types.
17. 'How are you?', 2 == true is false because true is equivalent to the number 1. (2) by itself is true because numbers other than 0 become true. 
19. [9,16,25], newArr pushes the value gotten by callback/doSomething. The given function squares whatever x is. So the forloop calls doSomething 3 times, with 1,2,3, which then calls the squaring function on these values + 2. So we get 3*3, 4*4, 5*5.
